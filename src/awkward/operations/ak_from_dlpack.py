    """Converts a DLPack-aware array into an Awkward Array.

    If the data are in main memory, they are not copied: the buffer is shared
    through the DLPack protocol. Data on another device (e.g. a GPU) are
    copied to main memory, which requires NumPy 2.1 or later and a producer
    that supports DLPack's cross-device copies.

    The resulting layout may involve the following #ak.contents.Content types
    (only):

    * #ak.contents.NumpyArray
    * #ak.contents.RegularArray if `regulararray=True`.

    Args:
        array: The DLPack-supporting array to convert into an Awkward Array.
        regulararray (bool): If True and the array is multidimensional,
            the dimensions are represented by nested #ak.contents.RegularArray
            nodes; if False and the array is multidimensional, the dimensions
            are represented by a multivalued #ak.contents.NumpyArray.shape.
            If the array is one-dimensional, this has no effect.
        highlevel (bool): If True, return an #ak.Array; otherwise, return
            a low-level #ak.contents.Content subclass.
        behavior (None or dict): Custom #ak.behavior for the output array, if
            high-level.
        attrs (None or dict): Custom attributes for the output array, if
            high-level.

    Returns:
        An #ak.Array built from the given DLPack-aware array.
